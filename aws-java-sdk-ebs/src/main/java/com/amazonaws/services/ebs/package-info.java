/**
 * <p>
 * You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) direct APIs to directly read the data on your EBS snapshots, and
 * identify the difference between two snapshots. You can view the details of blocks in an EBS snapshot, compare the
 * block difference between two snapshots, and directly access the data in a snapshot. If youâ€™re an independent software
 * vendor (ISV) who offers backup services for EBS, the EBS direct APIs makes it easier and more cost-effective to track
 * incremental changes on your EBS volumes via EBS snapshots. This can be done without having to create new volumes from
 * EBS snapshots, and then use EC2 instances to compare the differences.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This API reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types, parameters, and errors of the EBS
 * direct APIs. For more information about the elements that make up the EBS direct APIs, and examples of how to use
 * them effectively, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-accessing-snapshot.html">Accessing the Contents of an
 * EBS Snapshot</a>. For more information about how to use the EBS direct APIs, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-accessing-snapshots.html">EBS direct APIs User
 * Guide</a>. To view the currently supported AWS Regions and endpoints for the EBS direct APIs, see <a

 * General Reference</i>.
